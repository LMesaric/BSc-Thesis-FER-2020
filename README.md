# Zagreb District Model Based on Real Data
BSc Thesis at FER under the mentorship of prof. dr. sc. Željka Mihajlović

---

This thesis examines the procedure of automatic computer generation of a three-dimensional model of an arbitrary Zagreb district. The discussion is accompanied by
the implementation of the solution in software using the *Python* programming language in the form of an add-on for *Blender* toolset. The model is based on accurate
and publicly available data on terrain, buildings and trees, and is made in 1 : 1 ratio. NASA’s satellite images created using the ASTER sensor, spatial geoinformation
database *OpenStreetMap* and the Zagreb Green cadastre are described and used as data
sources. The generated city model consists of meshes without textures representing the
terrain, buildings with flat roofs and trees.

**Keywords:** 3D city model, 3D geoinformation, interactive visualization, Zagreb, OpenStreetMap, Blender, Python, Unreal Engine
